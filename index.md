### What does it look like?
Check out our [example page](https://aulloa.github.io/contribify/example)

### How we do it
We create webpages with a Monero miner, which is basically software which does a bunch of math for a cryptocurrency. In exchange for doing that math Monero gives you a some of it's coin, which could be traded for other currencies. Contribify lets your contributors navigate to a webpage and mine while sending 70% of the mined coin to you, by having hundreds of users leave the webpage open in the background or even overnight they can contribute without having to deal with cash.

### Don't Have a Monero Wallet?
Luckily there are plenty of Monero resources and wallets available. I don't have any specific recommendations but give it a google, get a wallet, and get started.
